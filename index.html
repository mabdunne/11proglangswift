	<p>
		<ul>
			<li>Introduced as "Objective-C without the C".</li>
			<li>For mobile application development, on iOS & linux.</li>
			<li>Cleaner (reduce useless syntax), safer (null/nil handling).</li>
			<li>Swift Playgrounds make programming interactive, approachable and fun.</li>
			<li>Swift Playgrounds were first introduced as a way to experiment with your code in Xcode.</li>
		</ul>

	<h2 id="example">Code Example</h2>
	<p>
		<pre>
		import Cocoa
		var str = "Chapter 4 Playground"
		func fahrenheitToCelsius(fahrenheitValue : Double) -> Double {
			var result : Double
			result = (((fahrenheitValue - 32) * 5) / 9)
			return result
		}

		var outdoorTemperatureInFahrenheit = 88.2
		var outdoorTemperatureInCelsius = fahrenheitToCelsius(outdoorTemperatureInFahrenheit)

	<h2 id="details">Details</h2>
	<p>
		<ul>
			<li>Compiled Language - compiled to machine code that runs on the Objective-C runtime.</li>
			<li>Strongly Typed - checks variable/argument types at compile time.</li>
			<li>Imperative - object oriented imperative language with some tools for programming functionally.</li>
		</ul>

	<!- https://www.reddit.com/r/swift/comments/2ffk7z/what_is_swift_imperative_functional/
	Looking at Swift it has:
mutable state, and language constructs for operating on it (loops, for example)
affordances for Object Oriented programming (built-in dynamic dispatch, inheritance, object types)
affordances for Functional programming (immutable types, closures, stdlib has useful higher order functions like map, reduce, etc...)
it does not have, however:
Recursively constructed types (lists, trees) in the stdlib, instead it has arrays and dictionaries
Tail-call optimization
So I think it'd be most accurate to describe Swift as an object oriented imperative language with some tools for programming functionally. It would be difficult to use it as a pure functional language at this point, due to the lack of tail-call optimization, and lack of stdlib and compiler support for recursive structures.
